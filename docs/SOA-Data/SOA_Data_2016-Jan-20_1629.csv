Rebalancing your portfolio
As part of our ongoing service we will review and rebalance your portfolio (if required) to ensure it is in line with your target asset allocation.  This rebalance will be completed on an annual basis or in the instance of any significant changes to your portfolio balance.  As your pension income is coming from cash this would require the selling of units in other asset classes, within the product, to rebalance your portfolio.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","Not Applicable","0","","","","0","","0","","0","","Not Applicable","0","","","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Include Strategy","-1","Heather to seek advice from a taxation specialist on the implications of selling the share portfolio especially as the shares have been inherited from her father's estate.","0","","0","","0","","0","","","Include Strategy","0","","0","","-1","Implement Enduring Powers of Attorney and Enduring Powers of Guardianship","--No Selection--","0","","-1","Review current Wills and update where required","","Retain inheritance in cash and shares.

Reasons why we are holding these policies:
Asteron policy is on Level Premium and it is not cost effective to replace this policy.

TAL Income Protection should be held because his business has not generated an income for the past 3 years. It is not possible to get Income Protection without proof of income

The purchase is to be a new house and land to the value of $420,000 plus costs. Costs will be about $7,000 with reduced stamp duty.

After reviewing their current super and Insurance arrangements the situation is 

?	Lynette needs to keep her policy at Asgard in place as she had a major operation a couple of years ago on her Kidney and is now unlikely to get cover elsewhere.  This allows for $5,000 rollover from Asgard to  an SMSF
?	Dean has a employer scheme that is transferring to a My super account  by 2017. The employer, VISY, currently covers the cost of Insurance and so this needs t be kept in place.
o	The action is to ensure that the new mysuper account can accept current Insurance. A spoke to OnePath (Brad 16 Jan @ 3.18pm advisor line) and they advised a rollover to ANZ Smart Choice can be completed over the phone by the client and retains the Insurance.  Takes about 20 Days. This would create an account with a balance of $170,000 plus any contributions.
o	Ongoing contributions are $57626 @9.5% as base Income is low then addition of 77to be assessed if can be paid to SMSF and not affect any Insurance. This to occur once property in place to access improved tax benefits. So initial position is that the Ongoing Contributions to remain with employer.
o	
?	Cost will be $ 11,000 in Govt fees, Bank Costs of $2500, Advice and set up fees of $5200 total of $18,700.

Strategy approach and actions ? 

1.	Rollover $165,000 of Dean?s account.
2.	Rollover $5,000 from Lynette Perpetual account to SMSF
3.	SMSF will have $170,000 and borrow 65% of $420,000 or $273,000, leaving 23,000 in the fund
4.	Costs are covered from the $23000.  There will be accumulated interest and a further $10,000 available if needed as the property will take 12 months to complete.
5.	SMSF Cash flow details 
a.	Annual audit cost of $440, 
b.	Accounting fees of $1500 
c.	Rental income on property of $330 per week, $17160 per annum.
d.	Rental costs @ 25% of rental income or $4290 per annum, Loan interest rate of 5.8% with interest only the approach.
6.

- Higher control super product (e.g. Wrap or SMSF) - current scale of funds not suited, however we will review this ongoing. When super funds exceed say $350,000 we can look at higher control solutions (more cost effective with scale).

Questions
Investment options of current ANZ Super accounts?

ANZ Smart Choice investment option = ""1970s""
- ANZ Super Advantage investment option = OnePath Managed Growth


Additional Expenditure outlined above is over the $100,000 available please amend?

- Expenditure (one-offs) does equal $80,000 (home reno + car) so this would theoretically reduce cash reserve to $20,000 from current $100K. However expenses will not be incurred until 2015 sometime. Happy for you to state cash reserve will reduce to $20k (minimum need is $10k in any case).

You have said - Leah you require life cover of $864,500 (must be increased to $1,051,500 to equal TPD amount) - but quote for life is $1,112,000?

You have said - Leah you require TPD cover of $1,051,500...but the quote is for $814,500?

NOTE: The Life & TPD amounts and quotes (Attached) have been adjusted slightly to -

- Life & TPD (Leah) = $1,168,500
- Life & TPD (Zeff) = $1,182,000

- To clarify regarding the insurance quotes - the TPD is structured cost efficiently so that CI also has an extended TPD benefit (i.e. if you add the TPD amount under policy 1 to the CI benefit you will arrive at the total recommended TPD amount.

As the clients have multiple structures and entities which impact tax and cash flow we have summarised how it impacts theie personal position in the attached spreadsheet (this should help modelling etc.)
Please refer to the Client Data overview spreadsheet attached (this has been reviewed by clients Accountant and is the most accurate summary of situation - where figures differ with Fact Find take this spreadsheet to be correct)

Income & Cash flow notes:
- From 2017 (Des' retirement) please assume the fully franked dividend from DNACo reduces by 50% as clients will retain 20% ownership in company long term (simply indexed dividend to inflation for modelling purposes)



Answers to questions below;

1. INCOME
Please ignore Rent Income in personal cash flow (rent is paid inside trust - client receives distributions ONLY which are the stated $30,000pa net of all Trust outgoings).

Current Trust distributions     Lyn     $30,000 (net of various costs including loan repayments inside Trust). Assume Trust distributions remain constant and Indexed by 5%pa.

2. EXPENSES - to clarify, (a) Donations should be EXCLUDED from personal cash flow as again these are coming out at a Trust entity level before distributions
                        (b) Retirement income goal of $100,000pa Includes annual holidays (i.e. Living need & annual holidays)

We are to extinguish all credit card  debt with the cash savings within the ING Account?
In the file note you have said the total credit card debt is $5,900. However based on the fact find this is $6,000. I presume we will go by figures in the fact find?
We are not to extinguish the personal loan debt as there are not enough funds to do so and establish a managed fund account?
Interest rate on the Personal loan, CBA Credit Card and Westpac Credit card?
The total repayment on these loans is $200 per month. What is the break down per loan or is interest only payable? 
There is cash held by family of $15,000. Can you advise more detail here?
Total expenditure is unclear - under mobile $50.000 per month?
Internet $30 per month?
I have assume total expenditure of $35,360 please confirm that is correct?
We will assume client is receiving income from the savings account?

Strategy required is rebalancing pensions. XPlan has been updated.

Need centrelink template as clients should be receiving greater benefits than they currently are. Use cashflow info in CALM.

Also require retirement accumulation analysis. CALM has been completed (current position January 2015)

Please feel free to call if you require anything (02) 4337 0755


Questions
We are to use all figures in Xtools. Therefore $9,000 cash and not the $5,000 entered in the fact find?

Fact find account based pension balances are different to the ones in Xplan presume we use Xplan here?

Can you provide a statement of both MLC pension accounts with all the underlying investments?

The strategy is to re balance in line with their risk profile of 70% growth. I can not see any recommendations of what investments you will be selling down and investing in within Xplan. Please provide the recommendation?

You have stated the ongoing fee of $6,600 is to come from the super accounts. Based on Xtools there is only a few thousand within super and they are retired. Is this to come from the pension accounts. Please advise?

We are to advise clients update Centrelink of their position within the SoA as they are not receiving as much benefits as they should?

In regards to Centrelink above if we are performing calculations we need the clients full assets, including cars, home contents etc. This will provide a more accurate Centrelink entitlement.?","SOA complete","","Jo Lediche","","","Erwin Cayabo","Cynthia Artificio","Not Assigned","0","0","","0","","Standard","330","Submit Order","2/3/2015 2:16:26 PM","Jo Lediche","3","1/23/2015 12:33:34 PM","","","",""

Strategy																								
Properties																								
* Sell Investment Properties now and use proceeds ($920,000) to fund selling costs of approximately 3% ($27,600) and repay associated liabilites ($453,763 + $5,022 break fee) and make a concessional self-employed contribution to Mario's new super fund of $35,000 to help offset CGT liability																								
* Use remaining proceeds of $398,615 to top up MKIS RSP to desired $150,000 initial investment (additional $70,508 approx) and then invest the remaining funds ($328,107) into the same MKIS into an IncomeBuilder option for wealth creation (shown in a separate projection)																								
* Cancel RSP as above once properties are sold as the clients will have a reduced cash flow after eliminating the properties																								
																								
Discussion Points/Future Strategies																								
* We will look to start a TTR Pension in the event that Mario's business take off and cash flow is more certain. We will look to use this to reduce tax and build wealth in super.","SOA complete","","Karina Dorogi","","","Erwin Cayabo","Cristeta Locara","Karina Dorogi","0","-1","","0","","Complex","990","Submit Order","2/12/2015 6:35:22 PM","Karina Dorogi","5","2/3/2015 11:48:07 AM","2/2/2015 12:28:50 PM","","",""

Alternatives Considered																
* Considered making a $540,000 contribution to Super for Susan to start a tax free pension however the income was not necessary. Investing these funds in super would be taxed higher than if held by Susan.																
* Full withdrawal of Sue's FSS then NCC to MLC MKSF H4 (risk profile). This will be below lifetime cap and allow for a tax free pension when Barry retires. We will wait until she is age 55 to complete this

Presume living expenses do not include debt payments?

Ongoing fees?

$100,000 in Listed Property Trusts
$100,000 in high yield shares

Neil and Ann, as part of our ongoing service we will review and rebalance your portfolio (if required) to ensure it is in line with your target asset allocation.  This rebalance will be completed on an annual basis or in the instance of any significant changes to your portfolio balance.

You require two sets of projections; 1. At what age can they retire on $58,000 per annum? 2. Retire at age 67 and how long there money will last. Please advise?

UK Pensions - you have stated you are still researching this. Do you have more information?  We are unsure where the contributions of $600 pa are to go?

Did you require projections for the alternative strategy? - your comment...* Provide this as an alternative scenario in projections as cash flows from our understanding won't support this just yet. I expect they will tighten their belts after this&#65533;	please advise?	

Is there super collection information for Westpac Super?

Strategy																			
Cash Accounts																			
* Start operating from a bank account instead of through the LOC to instill greater discipline and provide greater clarity financial planning																			
* Maintain mother's money as is to offset the mortgage. Maintain mothers $10,000 bank account as is as they do not have POA to invest more appropriately.

	* Save funds at $580/m into the business bank account for 2 months. Then use these funds to make an initial deposit of $1,160 into MLC Cash																		
	* Stop saving to business bank account and close account. Redirect this $580/m savings to the MLC H2 portfolio within this MKISF																		
Debt																			
* Recommend client make regular repayments of $715/fn onto the mortgage							These are the minimum P & I repayments over 17 years to eliminate the debt at retirement assuming they receive half of the offset account at retirement to repay the remainder												
	* Refinance loan to new 30 year loan to reduce minimum P & I repayments to assist with lumpy cash flow noting that the recommended total annual repayments we have recommended must be made

* Full Rollover of Sue's Uni Super to MLC MasterKey Super Fundamentals - H6 (risk profile and time frame and may provide the option for an earlier retirement)																			
UK Pensions																			
* Clients have ability to increase UK pension entitlements (FC still undertaking research on how to make the required contribution and how is it best to structure this considering exchange rate fluctuations)																			
	* Contributions I think can be made up to 6 years previous so start making contributions now as per above																		
	* From April 2016 we will be able to increase these contributions by approximately $600 pa to maximise their entitlements. Recommend that they make these increased contributions from that point in time.																		
Insurance																			
* Cancel Sue's existing policies once recommended insurance is in place. Existing covers innappropriately on stepped premiums and can be more effectively funded via super																			
* Also cancel Gary's MLC Life cover for same reason as above. Cancel gary's BT Super Insurance upon rollover to prefered fund.																			
* Maintain Gary's IP as it does not have a back exclusion as any future policies will considering the back operation since putting this cover in place.

The adviser on this one can be Greg Stevens.

The client is an existing client who basically has funds with us at the moment in a CFS retail fund (details attached).

He wants advice on moving the funds into his SMSF and putting the funds into comparable investments to what he has with same risk profile so that he can consolidate into his SMSF and also reduce some management fees.

Our investment service is such that we review each quarter and have the ability or scope to reduce or increase weightings/asset allocations in the portfolio if we see opportunities or risks so I would like this noted in there so it can be an ROA in the future.

We have addressed going to pension and the client is a bit hesitant so we would like it addressed as an alternative strategy so it can also be addressed at a later date or even at the time of presenting.

The clients have all estate planning under control and don't need advice here.  Same with insurance - we have advised them previously.

I have attached what we are recommending for investments - we will be setting up a Commsec Adviser Services account to trade through - brokerage is $33 or .011%.  We will also be setting up an Australian Money Market Cash Broking account for Macquarie Cash account and TDs (no commissions ect)

Trustees of SMSF are Helen John and Timothy Vickers.

Investment Strategy (SMSF) will be reviewed before proceeding with the advice and amendments will be made if necessary (waiting on accountant).

We will also coordinate with accountant for Binding Death Nomination paperwork for his wife Helen.

Pension paperwork also coordinated if that option is proceeded with.

Is the above self-employed income for each of them or combined?  
What are the living expenses?
Are you receiving ongoing commission for the Aviva insurance and if so what is the %?","SOA complete","","Karina Dorogi","Jacqueline Po","Not Assigned","Mellissa Edwards","Cristeta Locara","Karina Dorogi","0","-1","","0","","Standard","330","Submit Order","3/24/2015 1:30:04 PM","Karina Dorogi","10","","3/23/2015 6:47:21 PM","","",""

Risk Profiles: 

Client Specific Risk Profile &#65533; discussions

We reconfirmed Trevor and Kaye&#65533;s risk profile. We had last done profile questionnaires last year.  They&#65533;d indicated somewhere between 50-50 Cautious and 30-70 Moderate profiles for them.

We discussed that the stronger performance from some of the Growth assets has pushed them up to their current 30-70 benchmark and if nothing else we need to take some profit to go back to the overweight Defensive position that we had been targeting nearer 40-60.

Trevor reconfirmed that he had been a balanced 30-70 client for all of his time with us and that we could move to the 30-70 benchmark level or continue our tactical overweight.  Trevor was quite ambivalent about it, and he understands the need to take some profit and reallocate.  However, Trevor doesn&#65533;t want to adopt an excessively conservative asset allocation position and so was inclined to adopt the less Defensive posture on 30-70 Moderate for he and Kaye rather than make a shift to 50-50 Cautious.

To help determine the correct balance of investment risk for you, we have:

&#65533;	Asked you to complete a Risk Profile assessment. We have taken the results of this assessment and using a risk assessment model, on this basis we determined that your ideal balance at this time is to aim for a target mixture of approximately ##% Defensive investment assets and ##% Growth investment assets.
&#65533;	Explained that Defensive investment assets are there to provide stability of your investment capital and so are chiefly focussed upon the return of your capital in the short to medium term, rather than the return on it.

Conversely, we have also explained that Growth investment assets are there to provide growth of your investment capital and so are primarily focussed upon the long-term return on your capital, rather than the return of it. So they are far less stable.
&#65533;	Referred you to the MLC Strategic Overlay & Portfolio Design report for details of how the mixture of Defensive and Growth investment assets referred to above should be comprised.

The MLC Strategic Overlay & Portfolio Design report provides the basis for determining the mix of different investment types, so that your portfolio includes both the right combination of Defensive and Growth investment assets to meet your Risk Profile and also an appropriate mix of types of investments to anticipate the Economic and Financial Markets outlook (known as an Asset Allocation).

The MLC Strategic Overlay & Portfolio Design report is updated quarterly and is available via our web site at:
http://www.gpadviser.com.au/north-adelaide-brosnan/category/news/
&#65533;	Finally, we have also taken into account other factors that arose in our discussions and research of your situation.

replace this paragraph with the wording contained in the client&#65533;s File Note &#65533; Risk Profile discussion
Select the client&#65533;s investment risk profile from this list:
<Client>, based around all of the above we consider your investment risk profile is Cash. It has a 100%:0% split between Defensive and Growth based assets respectively.
<Client>, based around all of the above we consider your investment risk profile is Very Conservative. It has a 100%:0% split between Defensive and Growth based assets respectively.
<Client>, based around all of the above we consider your investment risk profile is Conservative. It has a 70%:30% split between Defensive and Growth based assets respectively.
<Client>, based around all of the above we consider your investment risk profile is Cautious. It has a 50%:50% split between Defensive and Growth based assets respectively.
<Client>, based around all of the above we consider your investment risk profile is Moderate. It has a 31%:69% split between Defensive and Growth based assets respectively.
<Client>, based around all of the above we consider your investment risk profile is Assertive. It has a 17%:83% split between Defensive and Growth based assets respectively.
<Client>, based around all of the above we consider your investment risk profile is Aggressive. It has a 0%:100% split between Defensive and Growth based assets respectively.
On the basis of this we specifically recommend that you adopt an Asset Allocation as set out below.

Risk & return discussion tools
We have discussed your Investment Risk Profile at length. However, this can often seem like an abstract concept until the realities of holding investments and seeing their behaviour is experienced. So we have provided some detail below, to give you specific examples of the variability of returns from major investment asset groups over both short and long periods of time.

Whilst the majority of value of this investment has been withdrawn progressively over an extended period of time and the value of the remaining holding is very small, this investment can not simply be sold upon request.

This investment has processes in place to progressively redeem / close down the investment fund.  It is simply a matter of time until this is resolved, but the small amount involved will mean that it does not materially impact your situation.
&#65533;	Suspended - Domaine SEQ Growth Trust Units Fully Paid - DOMSETGR1
This investment was effectively redeemed in a series of lump sum payments in 2012 and early 2013. However, outstanding tax requirements have prevented the final wind up of the trust. Accordingly it continues to appear in your statements for now. 

The main reasons for keeping or increasing these are:
&#65533;	It is not possible to sell or add to these investments.
&#65533;	Compliance regulations do not take such circumstances into account and thus we are required to make a declaration as if we are recommending this investment.
The risks of keeping or increasing these investments include:
&#65533;	None, as you have no sell/redemption options

Strategy
Recommend they speak with the Accountant and prepay the fee prior to June 30 estimate $500 plus $500 already paid = $1,000. to reduce tax payable

IFP will invoice the annual review fee of $4,400 for 2015/16 prior to June 30 so effectively paying this in advance for the next 12 months - currently fee is being deducted from the super accounts this will move to cashflow.

&#65533;         Do nothing &#65533; keep investment properties indefinitely, keep investments and cash

 
 
Scenario 2
&#65533;         Salary sacrifice $50,000 for the next 10 years (Super SA Fund allows higher CC Cap) with any cash shortfall from Cash and sell down of investments.

?	You would like to reduce your existing debt as soon as possible and have asked ?can your existing loans be paid off any quicker? 
?	 We have calculated how quickly it would take to repay your loans once we have restructured your assets so your SMSF can purchase your Business Real Property and the funds from the sale used to reduce your debts. For example if we have your business real property re-valued (as valuation has not been carried out for some years) and say it is now valued at $200,000.00 we can have the SMSF purchase property at the current market value and these funds can be used to reduce your existing debts to say $50,000.00. 
?	Than using your current repayments of $657.00 per Fortnight paid off your remaining loan balance of $50,000.00 dollars, @ your current interest rate of 4.95%, it would take approximately 3 years and two month to repay this debt 
?	Restructuring and paying down the remaining loan whilst maintain your current repayments at $657.00 Per F/N should enable you to save approximately $197,633.00 in interest repayments and 26 years 10 months off the loan repayment time.","","","","","","","","","","Separate section at the end of all advice stating Issues to Consider:

Should you decide to restructure loans from outside the super area to inside may have these additional benefits:
o	Improve before tax cash flow
o	Less profit left in the business to be taxed
o	Lease payments are being paid directly into your SMSF, which ensures your building (property) is paying its way.
o	Additional money is being paid into your super fund to help your future retirement plans (Lower Tax Environment)
o	The money contributed ensures greater Tax Advantage amounts are added to your SMSF.
o	The Loan is able to be serviced from the lease payments being made, surplus cash flow and yearly contributions being made. 
The additional amounts contributed to the SMSF due to the restructure will ensure additional capital to produce more Tax free income in retirement after age 60.","","","","","","","","","","","","Include Strategy","0","","-1","Separate section at the end of all advice stating Issues to Consider:

?	Steve & Cath, as your (SMSF) investment/assets grow you may have sufficient assets to be utilised to purchase property, provided you are able to meet all the listed requirements below and a lending institution will provide finance up to at least 60% of the current proposed purchase price.
?	To purchase a property inside your SMSF with borrowings a Non - Recourse Loan structure with an appropriate lender will be required. We will also need to establish a Corporate Security Trustee (Custodian - Bear Trust) to hold the asset (Business Real Property) on trust for the SMSF until the loan is repaid and the mortgage discharged. (Include the diagram for a Typical Borrowing Structure).    
?	You will need to consider the following steps  when setting up a Non-Recourse loan to purchase Business Real Property
o	Obtain Valuation Report for the Property prior to proceeding with the purchase.
o	Obtain a written arms-length rental appraisal for the property prior to agreeing to the sale and ensure the appropriate commercial lease is in place prior to the contracts being drawn up. 
o	Obtain approval for Non-Recourse Loan at a maximum of 60% of the property value; say $330,000 if the Property is valued at $550,000.
o	Sell the property to the NEW SMSF Entity to: 
-	Reduce the Number of loans
-	Clear personal debts
-	Allow the property to be owned by the SMSF
-	Rental/Lease payments will be made to the SMSF.
-	Any Lease and annual contributions could be adequate to pay off the loan within the agreed term and help pay out the balance of the loan years earlier than current projections.
-	Limit the liability to the business real property only via the SMSF.  
?	Ensure the property to be purchased is an asset that can be purchased under the SIS legislation.
?	Before any documents are signed and any deposit is paid, ensure advice has been sought from suitably qualified practitioner in the jurisdiction where the asset (Property) is located, to ensure the correct procedures are followed and no unnecessary stamp duty liability arises.
?	Ensure the contract for exchange must be in the name of the Corporate Security Trustee for the Bare Trust.
?	Once the contract for sale has been received confirm via your solicitor that the property being purchased is on the ONE title, the correct address is listed and the land Lot and Portfolio Numbers are of the land proposed to be purchased are listed accurately on the contract 
?	Once all documents have been received organise finance using a suitably qualified Mortgage broker or your current Bank.
?	Before paying a deposit or exchanging contracts ensure finance has been approved and Loan Agreement documents have been received, reviewed and executed as required.
?	Ensure the SMSF pays the deposit for the property, because if it is paid by another party, our understanding of current legislation is, it is treated as a contribution and not able to be refunded. 
?	You will need to ensure a commercial lease is drawn up reflecting current market value of lease payments that would reflect the value of the Business Real Property proposed. 
?	The lease is to be between the SMSF say Norvill Super Fund and the Tenant of the property SJ & CL Norvill Builders.  
?	Property Lease payments can be made to the fund

Life & TPD ? INSIDE SUPER
Steve
?	We recommend applying for $484,137.00 of Death Cover and $37,439.00 of TPD Cover via AMP ? These amounts of cover are currently held within your existing AMP Summit/North Super Insurance Policy, however, in order to free up cash flow and for the SMSF to pay/own the premiums this cover will need to be cancelled and replaced, and by applying for this cover ?Like for Like? (Level Premiums) with AMP you should not have to undergo any further medicals or underwriting. 
?	This will also lock in this level of cover listed above to prevent the insured amount reducing with your age, as is currently the case for your Insurance held via the Summit/North Super fund.   
?	If you were to apply for this cover under any other company you would be required to undergo medicals and full underwriting and this was a specific request that you did not wish to have to go through.

Steve, currently still has personal debts to clear, and you require your income protection cover to continue.  Steve, maintaining existing Critical Illness/Trauma cover to clear all or part of your debts is still important to you.
INSURANCE NOTES

Reasoning for rolling over to MLC																										
*Upon rollover to MLC, you will lose the centrelink deductibility of your current pensions ($28,367 for Gordon's SunSuper) and ($4,218 for Terri's LGS)																										
*However, clients are asset tested and therefore losing the centrleink deductibility is irrelevant. Our calculations also show that you will continue to be asset tests for the remainder of your life																										
*We have not considered gifting to reduce your assets, as only $10,000 per financial year, for three years, over a five year period, won't be assessed under Centrelink, the remainder will be deemed, as a result it doesn&#65533;t provide you with much more Age Pension

Questions:
1. What rental income is being received from the investment property?
2. Are the investment loan repayments included in the cost of living amount of $40,000 pa?
3. Should we exclude the credit card?  If you would like it included could you please supply the card limit and interest rate?
4. Which investment option will the pension payments be made from?
5. Can you please confirm no ongoing commission for MLC insurance cover?
6. There is conflicting figures in regards to the value of the investment property in the assets and then further on in the CDF under direct property.  Can you please confirm current property value?

Hi Karina,

Rather than using his income from the previous financial year, can the income being used for the modelling and SOA be based on what Garry?s income will be as of May 2015?   

As per the client profile, this is going to be 3/5 of his current income $170,000 pa (+ 9.5% SGC) as he will be reducing his workload from 5 to 3 days per week.  So if you could use the income figure of $102,000 pa (+ 9.5% SGC) that would be great.","SOA complete","","Mellissa Edwards","Kylie Ingenito","Not Assigned","Mellissa Edwards","Cristeta Locara","Karina Dorogi","0","-1","","0","","Standard","330","Submit Order","5/4/2015 4:04:14 PM","Karina Dorogi","7","","4/30/2015 2:10:34 PM","","",""

Another significant goal is full repayment of any outstanding debt by the time Steve is retired. Please note that this is addressed partially by super split to V for FY 15/16 then lump sum withdrawal in Aug 2016 to pay off some debt. Current outstanding is $215,000 with payments of $800 per FN. Assume fortnightly debt payment continues post the lump sum next year until Steve retires. Assume LS drawing is made to pay off balance in 2019. 

Please note that Vicki may receive a bequest of $200k at some point which would have a significant impact on retirement capital. In reality this would clear the debt but we will assume a conservative position on this and note that this may bridge any capital shortfall. 

Assume average portfolio return for any projections of 7% to age 75 and 5% thereafter, net of costs. 

How much do they require vs how much are they likely to have post strategies and debt payment. 

During the pre retirement phase assume no additional savings capacity as the balance of income net of salary sacrifice will be needed for lifestyle and renovation expenses. 

Vicki has 1 more year of IP claim, this is pretty much funding remaining renovation expenses. In a years time they will be living off 1 income. 

Post FY16 no super split to Vicki. 

We will add a note re potential Centrelink, but this will be a general comment only, we can adjust this once we have the draft. 

As noted, we have provided the investment recs based on $790k for Steve and $50k for Vicki assuming FY15 super split has been actioned. 

Our recommendation is likely to be MLC Wrap for both with fee aggregation and availability of preferred investment options. Note could use Australian Super member direct however not preferred option given limited access to preferred 'point of difference' investment managers. 

We will add notes re maintaining insurances.

This is a difficult one to explain in the above format as for a High net worth individual.

Client wishes to set up a Family Trust for $2.0 million initial deposit. Macquarie Consolidator will be used for the portfolio as a capped fee.

Initial portfolio recommendations are 
50 % F Int
26% Int'l Share
24% Aust Share

Specifics are in the diary note attached.

Because of the nature of this please let me know nay question or clarifications as I have done what I can think of to assist.

Questions:
1. In your stratgey notes you have mentioned 'My Eliza properties' in the investment plan section.  Is this meant to say Mt Martha?
2. There is a figure of $85,000 in income section in XPLAN.  Listed as other income.  Is this the rental income for Hamilton Island?  
3.The rental income for Hawthorn property does not seem to be entered into XPLAN.  Can I confirm the rental income to be $37,440 (gross) so we can enter it please?
4.There is an amount of $24,000 in expenses listed as 'other expenses' which I can not reconcile with your strategy notes.  Can you please confirm what this is?
5. Can you please confirm which of the insurance covers are paid out of pocket?  At the moment most of them are showing in expenses however some seem to be insurance via super.
6. The Hamilton Island Property is listed in XPLAN as a holiday home, however you have stated that it is a rental property. In addition, the value of the property in XPLAN is listed as $1.8mil but in your notes it is listed as $1.6mil. Please clarify?
7. There is a property in XPLAN valued at $11 mil.  (Sackville Street).  Is this correct?
8. The Mountain Grove property mortgage is listed in XPLAN as an investment property mortgage, but also listed in balance sheet as a primary residence.  Please clarify?
9.Details of the $2mil Term deposit are not in XPLAN.  Can you please provide these details or update XPLAN accordingly?
1. Can you please provide details of Claire's superannuation fund?","SOA complete","","Mellissa Edwards","Jacqueline Po","Not Assigned","Mellissa Edwards","Cynthia Artificio","Mellissa Edwards","0","0","","0","","Comprehensive","660","Submit Order","5/14/2015 1:15:42 PM","Mellissa Edwards","8","","5/13/2015 5:18:25 PM","","",""

Questions:
1. Can we please confirm the loans as being the following: PPR Loan $248,000. Truck Loan $20,000 Line of Credit $650,000
Gross NAB Loan facility approved @ NAB IS $650k, of which:
$248K is for personal Home Loan with P&I repayments implemented
$239K is for Business related purposes (includes the $20K Truck Loan) and Interest Only repayments made now.  This was refinance done in 2011
Balance is undrawn and hence no cost yet
Recent accountant discussion has confirmed Home Loan aggressively repaid and Business Loans IO only in nature until Home Loan repaid
Goal is to repay Home loan within 5 years, so using calculator the repayment needs to be $4343 per month for next 60 months @ 4.74% interest rate
Have requested copies of all NAB Loans and offset account to confirm rates and repayment history
 
2.Can I please confirm the Expenses as being: Business Loan (Is this for the truck or Line of Credit?) $32,796pa. PPR Loan $44,400pa.
They were paying P&I basis for both NAB loans as shown, but new repayments are
PPOR:  $4350/month ($52,200 p.a.) @ 4.74%
Business Loan: $944/month  ($11,328 p.a.) @ 4.74%
Any spare cashflows are deposited to Home Loan or Offset account (works same both ways)
 
3.You have advised there is a LOC of $650,000. How much of this is actually drawn down upon?
Answered as above
 
4. As Dawn is currently making standard member and voluntary salary sacrifice contributions to QSuper can we assume her SG to be 12.75%pa?
Dawn to advise &#65533; expect this weekend
 
5. Can you please confirm the Business Cover insurance cover amount and premium, the CP is unclear.
Nigel has ING/ONECARE policy # 10015688:
Income Secure Standard cover
Guarenteed $5,376/month cost $2,697.09
Stepped premium, 30 day wait, pmt to age 65
Occupation M, Non Smoker
Accident Option, YES
Increasing Claim, YES
 
Business expense cover is from ING/ANZ Onecare
Guarenteed pmt @ $4301/month and $1,153.47
30 days wait, Non Smoker, Occupation Class M
Accident Option YES, Premium Accident Option NO
 
6. For the insurance cover, should we assume that the clients have accepted the CPI increase and the cover amount is therefore the higher amount on the statements?
Yes please &#65533; include all CPI based increases to cover and costs
 
Additional subjective discussion re retirement and lifestyles as confirmed 7th May 2015:
Target $50,000 expenditure per annum for Nigel and Dawn now and in retirement
Includes living costs, some travel and &#65533;toys&#65533; in garage
Children are twins, now 19 years or age, and studying fulltime @ QUT
Upon retirement in 10 years, probably buy caravan and travel Australia
Possible downsize of the family home in coming 1-2 years as the acreage now called home is difficult to manage/maintain
If downsize occurs, this will probably release capital and make family home easier to manage for Nigel
Although income shows on Tax Return $30K after expenses, the gross income is much closer to $90-100K annually and the expenses are &#65533;optimised&#65533; to reflect tax deductible items

1. Can you please provide reasoning for implementing insurance via MLC Super rather than increasing insurance via Plum as they both provide MLC Insurance cover.
2.Is the salary sacrifice of $25,000 to go to Plum or MLC?
3. you have stated above that retirement income is $50,000 including $5,000 travel, however the client profile has the retirement income as $50,000 PLUS $5,000 travel.  Please clarify?

1. The goals section of the client data form describes expenses adding to a total of $37,000pa.  However in the Expenses section (pg 8) expenses come to $29,000.  Can you please confirm which is correct?
2.For the modelling, should we assume the cost of travel is included?  If yes, for how long/when?
3.You have mentioned that the client wants the availability of capital protection, but are you actually applying this to his new pension fund?  If yes, are you applying it to the whole balance?  What term?  
4.How are the funds to be invested for the new Super/Pension accounts?

Questions:
1. The goals section of the client data form describes expenses adding to a total of $37,000pa. However in the Expenses section (pg 8) expenses come to $29,000. Can you please confirm which is correct?
Answered last night that $37K is a more generous statement than initial $29K.  Full details provided in Sect A to arrive @ $37K                                                                                                                                                                       
 
2.For the modelling, should we assume the cost of travel is included? If yes, for how long/when?
Travel not a high priority as already defined, so can ignore for Y1 to 5 of projections.  More of a Long term goal ? that?s why it is in the LT section of goals

3.You have mentioned that the client wants the availability of capital protection, but are you actually applying this to his new pension fund? If yes, are you applying it to the whole balance? What term? 
Already fully  described in Client Objectives section.  Please read:
We have broadly discussed the cost of Capital Protection for MLC Index Plus Balanced fund being approx 1% of FUM with a 20 year horizon, ability to add capital over time being implemented. Detailed calculations to be provided to quantify exactly, but this is very close to mark for SOA purposes
 

4.How are the funds to be invested for the new Super/Pension accounts?
As described in Pension New and Investment Notes:
Commence a TTR Pension now by utilising $550K of funds with MLCMKSF account and placing in MKPF account paying $37,000 annually - which is his defined living costs with generous estimations provided for each living cost item shown in Fact Find docs.","SOA complete","","Mellissa Edwards","Jacqueline Po","Not Assigned","Mellissa Edwards","Cristeta Locara","Mellissa Edwards","0","-1","","0","","Standard","330","Submit Order","5/19/2015 3:00:42 PM","Mellissa Edwards","8","","5/10/2015 6:43:37 PM","","",""

Questions:
1.Is the home repayments included in the cost of living or on top?
2. Can we please clarify the underlying assets of the SMSF?  Looking at the Financial statement for 30 June 2014 - Cash is 294,378, Atlas Property Trust $1,002,329 and direct shares $170,076.  is this correct?  The figures in the CP are different.
3. Are the funds rolled over from GESB held in cash now?  So we should add this amount to the cash already held by the SMSF?
4.What investment option are the funds within GESB invested in?
5.When rolling over funds from GESB to SMSF are we to leave $5,000 in GESB?
6. Do the clients have personally owned bank accounts?  If yes, how much do they have? Are the contributions to come from these accounts?
7. Is the ongoing adviser fee paid via the SMSF or personally?

Client profile and modelling brief attached
Recommendations will follow

Scenario 1
?	100% of surplus cashflow including from the sale of Qanta shares to go towards home loan
?	Retire when Peter reaches 65
?	Sell investment property at retirement. Surplus to go towards home loan and the rest in cash reserves.

Scenario 2
?	Salary-sacrifice difference between SGC and $35,000 cap until retirement. Use cash reserves to fund if needed

?	Sell shares in 2016/2017 financial year and;
o	Put 50% towards home loan;
o	50% in a diversified investment strategy in Bridgette?s name ? 85% Growth and 15% Defensive. Reinvest dividends

?	Sell property and investment in 2025, pay off all debt and put the balance into Bridgette?s Superannuation

Other things to note:
?	Property has been purchased in Peter?s name.
?	Assume cash reserves in an offset account until possible.
?	Factor in $4,000 per annum in joint insurance costs until 2025 outside of super.
?	Key objective of the modelling is to assess how long their funds will last post retirement and to determine/validate the strategy outlined in Scenario 2
?	As noted in the client profile, the client has committed to purchase an investment property in February 2016.  Total cost $386,000.  A deposit has been paid of $37,000 ? Net loan will be $349,000.
?	Please apply standard assumptions to property investment and diversified investment

Find attached 9 month P&L for company. Assume income continues as per past 9 months. The company would have undistributed profits of approx. $100K. Historically they have paid company tax on this and then distributed to John as a dividend. I want to show effect of making salary sacrifice contributions of $29,000 each (using the precendent established in Ryan's case)
Historically John hasn't paid any personal tax due to franking from the company. 
Elaine's income comes from the truck & pump hire item in the P&L. Her income is below the tax free threshold.
I am trying to show that approx. $60K of super contributions will save them $9K this financial year. Post 1 July 2015 make $35,000 each. This would see a saving of $10,500.
They have a home loan of $270,000. John will be 60 in February 2016. Start TTR to use tax free income to repay loan.
They are currently paying 12K per annum to a friend but that will stop in a week. These funds are available to meet loan expense.
current loan repayments and living costs are in XPlan

The purpose of this account is to fund the secondary private education of the two boys as per the modelling done by QP previously #1.  &#65533;	Marcus DOB 9/1/12
&#65533;	Ethan DOB 28/2/14
&#65533;	PV costs for private education are $26k per child years 7 - 9 and $28k per child years 10 - 12. 
&#65533;	Marcus is expected to commence in 2024 and Ethan in 2026.
&#65533;	Inflation for costs to be 5% p.a.
&#65533;	Invested 15% defensive/85% growth risk profile.  
&#65533;	Fees of 1.5% p.a.
&#65533;	Capital to be extinguished after Ethan finishes year 12 (end of 2032)
Sell the CCA shares in Mat's name and contribute the proceeds into this new education plan account.
In time we plan to establish an SMSF for this client but for now propose using the existing MLC accounts to create a simple and concise retirement savings strategy.
Transfer both Matt and Jo's existing MLC Navigator accounts from pre Dec 11 to series 2 and family link them - highlight the fee savings.
Arrange for a non lapsing binding death nomination for Jo's account (nominate Mat).  Mat's account has a valid non lapsing binding nomination to Jo already.  
Rollover all but $10k from the existing Mercer Superannuation account to Jo's existing  MLC Navigator account.
Hold all existing investments in the MLC accounts pending advice via RoA for all potential asset classes in due course.
Maintain nominal balance in Mercer to Support existing personal insurances but move that balance to a 100% cash investment choice. 
Salary sacrifice $100 per week each into their MLC Navigator accounts.
Provide retirement projections based on the work you have already done under projections #2.  Without additional contributions they should be able to meet their goals.  But I want to start salary sacrificing to reduce their income tax and provide a buffer in their retirement nest egg to guard against early retirement, increase in retirement objectives as well as to create an enforced saving pattern.  Compare the benefits of the salary sacrifice in terms of income tax savings an increase in lump sum balance.
Remaining cash flow surplus to be used to reduce westpac mortgage debt.  How long before debt is 100% extinguished?

1. what are their living expenses?

3. Are there any alternative strategies that you would like inserted?
4. Was the $100K NCC on top of the $60K in the bank, therefore $60,000 left now?
5. Tessa, I could find the investments within the notes (in xplan). Can you please email this document to me?

Review Notes

Discussion Topics

    Review of Plan Objectives

    Gai stopped sal sac last Christmas as I had raised at previous meeting she was contributing too much and she needed to reduce it.  She stopped it altogether as cash flow was tight with Stephen not working.  We talked about re-starting again and that Stephen?s TTR pension can supplement her reduced take home pay.
    Planning to travel for 12 months in 2016.  They?re going to rent out their home for the year.  They?re expecting rental income of approx. $750 - $800 pw.  Plus supplement travelling costs from accessing Stephen?s super via a pension.
    Stephen is not actively looking for work given their travelling plans.  He?s being doing odd jobs and expects to get another $5k for the next 6 months.  Given his low level of income I recommended that he starts a TTR so that Gai can re-start sal sac and also earnings is tax free.  After tax offsets I calculated that there should be no tax payable on drawing the min. pension.

    Summary of Cash Flow

    Cash flow is presently being met from Gai?s net salary.  Stephen?s income has helped in the last couple of months so that more of Gai?s salary is saved.

    Timeframes (client modelling)

    Travelling all of 2016
    Return to full time employment from 2017

    Portfolio Performance

    We went over the ups and downs of market volatility and stressed the importance of investing for the long term and not being too focussed on market noise (e.g. Grexit)

    Portfolio Risk

    I pointed out that they have different target asset allocations for their various super accounts.  Plum super is 30G/70D, FSS is 70G/30D and their 2 MLC Wrap Super is approx. 57G/43D. 
        Gai said she didn?t know which option she was invested in and had picked the default.  I said that she can select a more defensive option if she wanted to.  However, she is happy to keep the same. 
        Stephen switched to a more conservative option with his Plum Super given that his not working and wanted to protect more of his capita.
        Both confirmed that they were happy to retain the MLC Wrap Super asset allocation as they are now.

Nevertheless, I said they can contact us anytime and don?t need to wait until we contact them.  Particularly when there is a change in their circumstances then they should just call.

Looking to set up a Special Disability Trust for Stephen, and transferring all shares and cash into the trust, which would be exempt from the asset test for Disability support pension purposes. 
Stephen will inherit the house that he currently lives in, valued at $410,000.
Stephen will be entitled to 30% of the shares and cash in the estate file, please ignore the property side of things, as that has been worked out and will not affect the trust. 
As a result of this, Stephen should be entitled to approximately $134,837 in cash and $321,490 in shares. .
With the Special Disability Trust, Stephen can transfer up to $500,000, to avoid having the excess classed as 'deprived assets. The combined amount of cash and shares will be less than the $500,000 cap
I have included a breakdown of what Stephen will receive as a result of the estate (which he will receive 30% of). The family only want one off advice for this, with no ongoing relationship. 
The shares will be managed by the public trustee, however protected in the trust itself and thus exempt from DSP asset testing.

1. In the CP Jodie's Income is stated at $60,000.  Then there is + $10,000.  What is the +$10,000?  Bonuses?  There is also an additional $3,000 listed as other income in XPLAN.  Please clarify what this is?
2. The expenditure in XPLAN was not matching the CP.  I do not think the CP expenses included the car loan.  I have the COL at $105,058.92  Do you agree?
3. There is a large difference in balances for the Mercer Super Fund between XPLAN and the Client profile.  Are we to use the XPLAN balances?
4. What expenses are currently salary packaged?
5. What amount of SG are they receiving?
6. What ongoing commissions apply to the MLC Insurance?
7. Can you please review the insurances above and confirm our understanding of the policies?

Questions:
1. The file note says that they have repaid all but $3,000 of their personal loans, however XPLAN shows multiple loans in place.  Could you please advise which ones are still current?
2. Where is the $2,000 for the new investment to come from? Portfolio's only shows $500 in Bradley's account.
3. The file notes mention a super consolidation.  Is this strategy to be included in the advice?
4. Can you please confirm the rest of the super details are correct as these have been taken from XPLAN.

1. For modelling purposes, can you please provide the current home loan repayments?
Also, are the loan repayments included in the cost of living of $48,000 or are they on top?
2. There are various other loans of $160,000.  Can you please provide more details such as interest rates and repayments so we can model this?

The client has recently purchased a new house.  We have sold down their MLC Masterkey investment portfolio/Margin Loan to minimise the non-tax-deductible debt the client needs.

He wishes to recommence the investment strategy.  His accountant has instructed that due to embedded capital losses in an existing family trust the investment should be re-established in the name of that trust (ADSAM Investments Pty Ltd ACN 130 732 357 ATF Trayer Family Trust).

The structure is a monthly contribution of $1,000 plus a monthly loan advance from a new NAB Margin loan of $1,000.  The investment is Horizon 6 via MLC Masterkey.

The client has a 15/85 risk profile and has existing Life/TPD and IP insurance in place.

Questions:

1. The Assets are quoted in NZ.  Does this mean we need to convert the asset values to Australian Dollars?
2. There is current savings in XPlan Balance Sheet of $19,600 however this is not in the file note (FN has $190,000).  can you please confirm if this is still existing?
3. The Savings is not entered into portfolios, just Balance Sheet.  Would you like us to include it in the asset allocation?
4. Who owns the savings?  Jointly?
5. What are the Managed Investments of $200,000?  Would you like this asset included in the SOA?  If yes, could we please have the details of the platform and underlying assets?


1.Yes please convert to AUD.
2. Please remove the $19,600 and update with the $190,000 as per the adviser notes.
3. No just include the cash/savings and managed funds under balance sheet, but don&#65533;t include in the overall asset allocation. Please make a note in the asset allocation section of the advice that the asset allocation only relates to the MLC Wrap portfolios.
4. Assume jointly held.
5. Just include the $200,000 managed fund in the balance sheet with a comment that no further details provided.","SOA complete","","Mellissa Edwards","Jacqueline Po","Not Assigned","Mellissa Edwards","Cristeta Locara","Karina Dorogi","0","-1","","0","","One Strategy","220","Submit Order","9/9/2015 10:29:40 AM","Karina Dorogi","9","9/1/2015 10:47:49 AM","8/26/2015 4:15:49 PM","220","0",""

Please note that i have not loaded all client details into X plan and portfolio will need to be added as well.

The notes on front of fact give details.

Please note I am not giving any advice on Personal Cashflow, so the income earned is all used to meet personal living expenses.  clients will earn what they need to make the personal cash flow work. Investment property in own name will be held and is owned 50/50 which will assist with personal cash flow.

I need a calculation of the benefit of undertaking SMSF LRBA for next 15 years compared to not with the loan interest at 5.5% and interest only.  Assume loan is paid out at 15 year point. Property growth rate is 4% and income is 4% net yield after costs.or 5% before.

three sceanarios will be needed.  Retirement Income Projection to age 90 for Anthony for each to compare , plus the amount held in Supr at age 71 or 15 years for Anthony.

(David)
We have run the numbers on David retiring end of this calendar year (31/12/15) vs Early next FY (July 2016) and the taxation consequences of Leave entitlements paid at those dates.

In short, the average tax rate on the Annual & LSL (of which almost all will be subject to MTRs) would be:
-   42% approx. ($61,500) if David retires 31/12/2015 vs 
- 39% approx. ($57,000) if David receives them in July 2016

Though there would likely be some income tax saving, David would have forgone 6 months worth of CSS Pension benefits which equate to approx. $33,500. 

Therefore we see no significant benefit in delaying retirement simply to receive Leave entitlements in a new FY.   

Please assume David is therefore paid out his AL & LSL in a cash lump sum on retirement at 31/12/2015.
Gross $146,416 after tax is estimated to be $85,000.
We recommend adding these funds ($85k) to super. as NCC.

Investment recommendations have been directly input into the Portfolio recommend screen by Joanna (Adviser). I have also uploaded the screenshot of the investment recommendations so you can see what was input on 30/9/15. Please note the comments on the screenshots as the Cash had to have an additional two zeros added to ensure the asset allocation came out correctly (known issue by IRESS - hopefully to be fixed in the new upgrade).

N.B PRYHA matured on 28/9/15 and proceeds going into cash.

Considered more aggressive investments and Capital Protection to protect downside movements, but Drew is not sold on any insurance value at all.

Considered the need for Life and TPD cover, but as he is single this does not leave any others disadvantaged if he passes away for any reason.  This is why we have focussed upon quality IP and Trauma at this time alone

&#65533;	I am considering a TTR strategy for the client and hence wondering what the dollar benefit each year is to the client in an increased super balance (and cumulative for the remaining two working years) in commencing a pension in 2016 and 2017 (Age 60 and 61 nominally) and increasing the salary sacrifice above the current level to ensure the take home pay remains the same.","SOA complete","","Karina Dorogi","Mellissa Edwards","Not Assigned","Mellissa Edwards","","Not Assigned","0","0","","0","","Other","165","Submit Order","10/13/2015 3:56:58 PM","Mellissa Edwards","4","10/6/2015 1:32:36 PM","10/5/2015 3:10:26 PM","","",""

Additional needs evident including Income Protection for Louise (as indicated she needs in Fact Find) and also Trauma component for both.  Have produced quotes for client but not really requested at this time.  
Also Estate Planning needed - no wills in existence today yet clients need this.  Probably future SOFA work needed but no agreement as yet for either topics as specifically scoped out of the advice requirement at this time.
Please add specific wording within the SOA to confirm the need for these topics to be addressed and willingness to do in coming months as part of the Ongoing Service Proposition

Although Alan is seeking employment in his older roles, nothing forthcoming, and no real rush it seems.  Have confirmed his preservation age is 56 years of age, and so one strategy they are keen to explore is ""retiring"" on 8th August 2016, and so cashing in all existing Super balances available then and paying out their home loan entirely thereafter and then claiming any Centrelink benefits then available - Newstart and Health Card card might be best to focus upon as too young for Age Pension.  But again, not part of the brief at this time, but might be focus for further advice in coming months.

Hi Karina

I know I am a dummy at times

I have approved the SOA job for clients HOPE x 2 but did not really define what the changes were that needed addressing

What I was trying to say was that the Insurances are technically &#65533;out of the client scope&#65533;  yet important to document

So we need to find a way to say, 

&#65533;This is important, but you did not ask for this, and because I am good at my job, these are the alternate answers to the questions not yet fully asked&#65533;

I know I am a dummy at times

I have approved the SOA job for clients HOPE x 2 but did not really define what the changes were that needed addressing

What I was trying to say was that the Insurances are technically ?out of the client scope?  yet important to document

So we need to find a way to say, 

?This is important, but you did not ask for this, , these are the alternate answers to the questions not yet fully asked?

&#65533;	You would like to reduce your existing debt as soon as possible and have asked &#65533;can your existing loans be paid off any quicker&#65533;

&#65533;	By restructuring your existing loans into one Variable rate loan all at a lower interest rate of say 4.83%.
&#65533;	By selling down the Colonial FirstChoice Investments and using the proceeds to reduce your personal debts (Bad Debt), down to approximately $106,144.
&#65533;	Increasing your fortnightly repayment by $500 to $1,000 per F/N from your projected surplus income. This will reduce the interest being paid and save over $90,000 in interest repayments. 
&#65533;	This strategy will have the loan paid off in 4 years and 7 months.   
&#65533;	Based on your stated current repayments of $500 per fortnight, it would take approximately 17 years and 10 months to repay these debts if combined. However some of these loans are interest only and no principal repayment are being made so the actual repayment term may be longer than this stated repayment term.","","","","","","","","","","Should you decide to restructure loans from outside the super area to inside may have these additional benefits:
o	Improve before tax cash flow
o	Less profit left in the business to be taxed
o	Lease payments are being paid directly into your SMSF, which ensures your building (property) is paying its way.
o	Additional money is being paid into your super fund to help your future retirement plans (Lower Tax Environment)
o	The money contributed ensures greater Tax Advantage amounts are added to your SMSF.
o	The Loan is able to be serviced from the lease payments being made, surplus cash flow and yearly contributions being made. 
The additional amounts contributed to the SMSF due to the restructure will ensure additional capital to produce more Tax free income in retirement after age 60.","","","","","","","","","","","","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","","Include Strategy","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","Client","CBUS Super","273627.0000","Growth (my Super)","","","","","","Partner","Care Super","61682.0000","","","","","","CommInsure Life $256,803K, TPD $138,540K, CI $138,540","","Include Strategy","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","&#65533;	Setup a SMSF to provide the appropriate Superannuation structure to purchase and hold/own your Business Real Property.

&#65533;	 Mark & Lesley, you are both currently earning $135,890.00 pa and $79,541 pa respectively. 
&#65533;	Mark, we recommend rolling over your existing Super fund &#65533; CBUS Super  - approx. $273,628.00 to the new recommended SMSF (Multiport /MLC Wrap Investment Fund Portfolio) in line with your identified risk profile of 30% Defensive & 70% Growth  investor

&#65533;	Mark the property you wish to purchase is the premises you are currently operating your business out of, but you are not sure if the current owner will sell this building to you however you still wish to have the SMSF set up ready to purchase a property (Business Real Property) to utilise some of the SMSF assets to achieve this.  
&#65533;	The business real property is to be leased back to your trading entity A1 Windscreens at the current expected rental rate of approx.. $20,000 pa for a property of its type and location
&#65533;	Before proceeding with our recommendations you as individuals read the ATO publication about the responsibilities you will undertake as Trustee of your own SMSF and that you are happy to take on Trustee se responsibilities before proceeding. 
CONTRIBUTIONS &#65533;Non Concessional, Concessional & SGC
&#65533;	Make ongoing non-concessional & concessional contributions to the maximum allowed if surplus funds allow.
&#65533;	Ensure your future Super Contributions are directed and paid into the new recommended SMSF.
&#65533;	By continuing to contribute to your SMSF will allow sufficient funds inside the SMSF to increase your retirement savings and should allow the purchase of an investment property as part of the SMSF.
HAVING YOUR OWN SMSF WILL GIVE YOU:
&#65533;	Greater control over the Investment decisions within the SMSF
&#65533;	Allow you to purchase direct property and/or direct shares within the fund.
&#65533;	The SMSF is individually taxed, allowing for more efficient individual investment strategies to help minimise the overall fund effective tax rate.
&#65533;	The SMSF structure can be utilised to purchase direct property and/or borrow additional funds if required to accomplish the property purchase.
&#65533;	Direct property depreciation schedule will help reduce the effective tax paid within the fund.
&#65533;	Direct Share imputation credits will also help reduce the effective tax paid within the fund.  (Direct Australian Shares with Franking Credits can also ensure the net SMSF benefits are maximised by helping to reduce the effective SMSF tax rate and/or be instrumental in the fund claiming tax back from the ATO)
&#65533;	The ability, as Trustees of your own SMSF to formulate your own Investment Strategy with the ability to select Advanced Planning&#65533;s model Investment portfolio, as part of your overall investment strategy.
&#65533;	The fund can accept all types of contributions including, Salary Sacrifice, Employer, Member and Award, etc.
&#65533;	The SMSF can borrow to purchase the investment property if required. (Conditions apply)
&#65533;	If a property is Business real property it can be traded with a related party if required. If this type of transaction is executed correctly, it can translate into significant net financial benefits that can greatly increase your net retirement income.

&#65533;	Mark & Lesley, as your (SMSF) investment/assets grow you may have sufficient assets to be utilised to purchase property, provided you are able to meet all the listed requirements below and a lending institution will provide finance up to at least 60% of the current proposed purchase price.
&#65533;	To purchase a property inside your SMSF with borrowings a Non - Recourse Loan structure with an appropriate lender will be required. We will also need to establish a Corporate Security Trustee (Custodian - Bare Trust) to hold the asset (Business Real Property) on trust for the SMSF until the loan is repaid and the mortgage discharged. (Include the diagram for a Typical Borrowing Structure).    
&#65533;	You will need to consider the following steps  when setting up a Non-Recourse loan to purchase Business Real Property
o	Obtain Valuation Report for the Property prior to proceeding with the purchase.
o	Obtain a written arms-length rental appraisal for the property prior to agreeing to the sale and ensure the appropriate commercial lease is in place prior to the contracts being drawn up. 
o	Obtain approval for Non-Recourse Loan at a maximum of 60% of the property value; say $......... if the Property is valued at $............
o	Sell the property to the NEW SMSF Entity to: 
-	Reduce the Number of loans
-	Clear personal debts
-	Allow the property to be owned by the SMSF
-	Rental/Lease payments will be made to the SMSF.
-	Any Lease and annual contributions could be adequate to pay off the loan within the agreed term and help pay out the balance of the loan years earlier than current projections.
-	Limit the liability to the business real property only via the SMSF.  
&#65533;	Ensure the property to be purchased is an asset that can be purchased under the SIS legislation.
&#65533;	Before any documents are signed and any deposit is paid, ensure advice has been sought from suitably qualified practitioner in the jurisdiction where the asset (Property) is located, to ensure the correct procedures are followed and no unnecessary stamp duty liability arises.
&#65533;	Ensure the contract for exchange must be in the name of the Corporate Security Trustee for the Bare Trust.
&#65533;	Once the contract for sale has been received confirm via your solicitor that the property being purchased is on the ONE title, the correct address is listed and the land Lot and Portfolio Numbers are of the land proposed to be purchased are listed accurately on the contract 
&#65533;	Once all documents have been received organise finance using a suitably qualified Mortgage broker or your current Bank.
&#65533;	Before paying a deposit or exchanging contracts ensure finance has been approved and Loan Agreement documents have been received, reviewed and executed as required.
&#65533;	Ensure the SMSF pays the deposit for the property, because if it is paid by another party, our understanding of current legislation is, it is treated as a contribution and not able to be refunded. 
&#65533;	You will need to ensure a commercial lease is drawn up reflecting current market value of lease payments that would reflect the value of the Business Real Property proposed. 
&#65533;	The lease is to be between the SMSF say MR & LT Cotter Super Fund and the Tenant of the property A1 Windscreen.
&#65533;	Property Lease payments can be made to the fund
&#65533;	The property purchased by the SMSF must be revalued at market value each year. Independent third party valuations should be obtained at least every three years, with valuations from all other years being supplied by the Property Manager or Trustee Declaration.  
&#65533;	Trustee responsibilities for LRBA
&#65533;	The money may be able to be invested in a more diversified way to produce similar returns with a much lower Investment risk.
SMSF &#65533; PROPERTY SALES AND POSSIBLE OPTIONS
&#65533;	The Trust Deed should reflect SMSF Borrowings so the SMSF can borrow to purchase the property.  (Conditions apply)
&#65533;	Our understanding is that the assets held in your Property Trust will be classified as Business Real Property and as Business real property can be traded with a related party if required. If this type of transaction is executed correctly, it can translate into significant net financial benefits that can greatly increase your net retirement income.
&#65533;	Under current legislation, if the Property inside the SMSF is sold when in pension phase, no Capital Gains Tax is payable.     
&#65533;	Direct Australian Shares with Franking Credits can also ensure the net SMSF benefits are maximised by helping to reduce the effective SMSF tax rate and/or be instrumental in the fund claiming tax back from the ATO.","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","Include Strategy","0","","","","0","","0","","0","","Not Applicable","0","","","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","M & L CommInsure Life $256,803K, TPD $138,540K, CI $138,540","&#65533;	Insurance cover is to protect all retirement assets and to provide sufficient money be available inside the SMSF to pay all debts or financial commitments when they fall due, in the event of Death or TPD.

Recommendations.
The Kulaendra Family Super Fund (SMSF).  
Strategy is aimed at tidying up the various Pensions and looking to reduce Taxable components of the SMSF. Also, take into account Mrs K turns 65 on 22 December 2015.   

2015/2016

10 November.  
&#65533;	DR K should cash out his P3 of $60,128. 
&#65533;	Dr K should take a Pension Payment from n P1 of $480,000.
&#65533;	This will provide $540,000.
&#65533;	Mrs K should make min pension payments for 6 months from her P2 and P3 Pensions &#65533; say $3,021 and $3,600 respectively. 
17 November 2015
&#65533;	Mrs K should (using the $540,000 above) make a NCC of $540,000 using provisions of bring forward rule.  
&#65533;	She should (having made min payments) rollback her P2 and P3 Pensions to accumulation, pick up the $540,000 NCC and recommence a Pension. She should take legislated minimum for remaining FY and every FY after this.
15 January 2016
&#65533;	DR K should take another Pension Payment from his P1 of $120,491.
&#65533;	Mrs K, now being Age 65, should cash out her P4 interest entirely ($59,509). 
&#65533;	DR K should take min pension payments from his P2, (say 10 months) or $7,500.
22 January 2016
&#65533;	Dr K K should (using the $180,000 above) make a NCC of $180,000.   
&#65533;	Dr K should (having made min payments) rollback his P2 to accumulation, pick up the $180,000 NCC and recommence a Pension. He should take legislated minimum for remaining and every FY after this.
10 June 2016.
Both Dr K and Mrs K should each make CC contributions of $35,000.  They should aim to cash these out at the beginning of each new Fy &#65533; in July 2016.

2016/2017 and beyond.
Dr K
Dr K should look to make NCC of $180,000 each FY that he works up to Age 75 &#65533; 2020/2021 for him.  He should look to employ the same strategy of funding the NCC from larger drawdowns from the P1 interest which is 77.87% Taxable.  

After taking the legislated minimum pension payment from his largely Tax Free Pension, he should rollback this to accumulation, pick up the NCC made, and then recommence a Pension.

Indeed, given that the P1 interest is 77.87% Taxable, this should be the Pension that will be the go to source of all NCC contributions &#65533; both for Dr k and Mrs K.

He should look to make the CC contributions, but again, only after making the NCC and Pension refreshment t. The CC can then be cashed out in July of the following FY. 

Dr  needs to be mindful that any contributions needs to be done within a month of him turning 75.

Mrs K 
Mr K should next look to make a NCC of $180,000 in 2018/2019 and every FY that she works up to Age 75 &#65533; 2025/2026 for her.  She should look to employ the same strategy of funding the NCC from larger drawdowns from Dr K P1 interest which is 77.87% Taxable and the from her P1 Interest which is 57.50 taxable.

However, we will look to revisit where the NCC come from as there will become a time when Mrs K P1 Pension will be the best place to source funds for NCC strategies.

She should look to make the CC contributions, but again,( if making an NCC) only after making the NCC and Pension refreshment t. The CC can then be cashed out in July of the following FY. 

Para planning, please illustrate the potential tax savings (with SMSF proceeds going to Estate) using the above strategies assuming contributions are mad till Age 75 for both Dr K and Mrs K.  

Please note, the SMSF has no Reserves available to pay anti-detriment payments and the lumpy nature of the assets prevents rollover to commercial provider.

Non Super
Cash Flow
Show cash flow as follows:
&#65533;	Salaries less deductions (see tax return)
&#65533;	Interest on $250,000 cash at 3% for her.
&#65533;	Legislated Minimum payments that aren&#65533;t going to fund NCC
&#65533;	Trust Distribution for her.

Modelling
What will SMSF look like at Age 75 for her &#65533; in 2025/2026.  What will the Pensions look like in terms of Taxable and Tax Free components after all NCC have been completed?","SOA complete","","Karina Dorogi","Jacqueline Po","Not Assigned","Karina Dorogi","Cynthia Artificio","Karina Dorogi","0","-1","","0","","Three Strategy","660","Submit Order","11/4/2015 10:07:39 AM","Mellissa Edwards","7","10/20/2015 2:12:48 PM","10/19/2015 11:06:31 AM","660","0",""

Current SMSF is worth $383,000- total balance invested in the Macquarie Investment Consolidator. Cash account $176k and balance in equities.
TDH Engineering Pty Ltd makes employer contributions of $35k pa each for Trevor and Merrilyn- this gets paid into the MIC.
As discussed above- recommendation is to sell commercial unit from partnership to the SMSF- via a LRBA. Will refer this to Melissa- Melissa has a Broker arrangement with NAB Broker and she gets remunerated on the deal. She will liaise with NAB Broker and facilitate the lending. They will also create the Trust deed. Melissa will organise the set up of the bare trust and all the necessary legal and accounting requirements- check trust deed and amend etc. She has had a lot of experience with these LRBA transactions.
Based on a valuation of $750,000- NAB broker have advised they will require a 30% deposit- $225k. This will be funded as follows:
&#61623; Use Cash account balance- $165,000- retain $10,000 as buffer
&#61623; Sell down all equities ?very heavy resource focus- should realise $207k
&#61623; Allocate $225,000 for the LRBA arrangement
&#61623; Balance of $148,000 ? after LRBA and cash reserve allocated as:
1. Macquarie Income Opps Fund- 10%
2. Vanguard Aust FI Fund -10%
3. Magellan Global Fund- 20%
4. Northward Equity Income Fund-40%
5. Macquarie Infrastructure Fund- 20%
Ongoing contributions will be $70,000 pa. Rental lease will be $55,000 pa. Assumed interest rate on loan at 7% and associated repayments will be funded via lease and contributions.
Include all checklists from Accounting and legal that needs to be considered to facilitate the LRBA.","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Not Applicable","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","Include Strategy","0","","","","-1","AXA - M (AMP Wealth Protection) $121,550.63

&#61623; Recommend that she revert back to the 14% contribution rate- her income for the 2014/15 FY was $319k- so she was liable with Div 293 tax. It is unlikely that this will be the case again this year- but need to make mention of this.
&#61623; The above will take her SGC to $30,480 pa- she will be liable for Div 293 tax on $480- but she will get the $$ into super. This will also help reduce her tax bill.
&#61623; Recommend that she roll her MLC MKSF to a new MLC Wrap Super Fund- she wants access to more flexible investment options and be able to grow her super aggressively. Invest the rollover and all SGC as under:

I have attached a number of documents to give you further details.  My assistant is off unwell for a while so could you complete the data entry for the assets and investments as I may muck it up .

The portfolio Spreadsheet has the asset allocation % and once the amount to be invested is known you can put this in and will give you the dollars to be invested.

If I have missed anything let me know.

A ""How long will the money last based on current status would be great. If I can get the graph in A$ size  that would be helpful to add to my presentation.

The Macquarie Wrap Super Manager account will remain open to accept any future contributions.  Please note Geoff will need to maintain $2,500 in the Super Manager Cash Account to meet the minimum requirement.   

Recommendation is to take the minimum pension payments paid monthly.

Key reasons:
- Boost tax free income
- Zero tax payable on earnings for the funds in pension mode as compared to 15% tax on funds in accumulation.

Please see DropBox folder for all relevant documents.

Adviser is James Boon.

Please do not complete modelling for this client. Please include a cash flow without using XTOOLS.

We are to start two MKSF funds as one will start an MKPF (from redundancy proceeds) and the other will be rolled over from current super fund.

Bank Savings and Redundancy Proceeds											
* Eliminate mortgage debt (it's a drain on cash flow and costing interest)											
	Draw sufficient funds from this portfolio to fund living costs (monthly version of E18 above)										
* Invest $210,000 into an MKISF to cover planned expenses (H1 for first $30k, H2 for next $70k and H4 for remaining $110k)											
* Also utilise $8k from bank account that he is looking to invest (will retain $10k cash reserve)											
* NCC remaining funds (cell Q38) to MLC MKSF H4 #1 then rollover into MLC Pension (asset per attached asset allocation) for tax free pension											

Discussion - Lump Sum vs Pension																	
* Rob will have a significant estate regardless of the decision however his estate will be far better off if he takes the lump sum (especially considering his health). More importantly his sons wouldn't receive anything from the DB Pension																	
* Take Super as a lump sum (cell Q42) and rollover to a new MLC MKSF H4 #2 portfolio (risk profile, diversification, flexibility, greater estate for his sons, better personal income tax outcome)																	
	* FC to add discussion around the estate planning VS longevity conversation																
Discussion - Future Recontribution Strategy																	
* Add a discussion about the value to his estate of a recontribution strategy starting in 2020/21 FY (withdraw tax free and recontribute from taxable super to tax free super)																	
Direct Shares																	
* Sell down all existing shares																	
	* Wait to sell the shares down after 1 July. This will allow BHP shares to recover after recent bad media and will allow him to save heaps of tax (we are holding off until July 1 as he will have the max MTR as a result of the redundancy payour																
	* NCC Proceeds of share sale to MLC MKSF #1 account																
		* Add a discussion point around rebooting pension existing account is fully drawn down															
Debt																	
* Recommend the client rmake interest only repayments on each of his $97k loans, monthly in arrears, and that he fix the variable portion of the mortgage.																	
	* Add a discussion that without doing this he will errode his wealth much faster, thus impacting the estate for his sons. Recommend Donna continue to chip away at the debt with her own contributions																
		* FC to add a discussion that continuing the current arrangement, while it would eventually repay the debt it would cause his retirement savings to run out XXX years earlier		

	Insurances																	
	* We have reviewed situation and Rob is able to self-insure. Cancel existing insurances as they are an innappropriate expense																	
	Centrelink									 								
	* Rob will not be entitled to any Centrelink benefits at this time, we will continue to review.																	
	Estate Planning																	
	* Existing Will, EPOA and EPOG are appropriate																	
	Fees									Balance	Fee by %	Fee Rounded						
	* Initial fee - $7,500		charge proportionally as highlighted >>>>						MKISF	$210,000	$1,017	$1,000						
	* Ongoing at 1% on MLC investments								MKSF	$1,338,156	$6,483	$6,500	Charge to super #2 only					
	Projections - Completed by FC. Please Do Not Open.								Total	$1,548,156	$7,500	$7,500						
	* Now until 2017 (1 year) - $96,000 + net running costs of property																	
	* 2017 until 2019 (2 years) - $90,000 + net running costs of property																	
	* 2019 until LE (32 years) - $88,000 + net running costs of property																	
		* FC needs to update the rates on the pdebt projections.																
	Assumptions																	
	* Exclude the value of the property in the projection figures of the document but ensure it is present in retirement modelling to provide accurate Age Pension entitlement																	
																		
	Notes																	
	* Client believes he won't live past his 80s due to his health?.consider showing benefit of lump sum vs pension with this in mind?														FCMS Referral Information

* Sell all shares ($150,556) and repay associated investment loan ($80,414), utilise proceeds to establish a savings plan  - approx. $70,142 (loss on shares - approx. $23,438, so no CGT payable)

* Maintain $10K in B/A for cash reserve $33,700pa available (used to repay debt/invest into managed funds - see transaction summary on side)																
* Michelle has a T/D of $11K - maintain 																
																
Debt Management																
* Repay investment loan in full from share proceeds																
* Repay mortgage in full to free up cash flow																
* Maintain LOC to continue to have funds available 																
* Client has a novated car lease, at the end of the lease the balloon payment is $20,240 (Feb 2016). Client wishes to extend his lease for another 12 months. 	

Planned Expenses / Savings Plan										
* Invest $89,817 into H2 ($1,000 in cash)										
* RSP of $3,600 per month ($43,200pa) into H2 to fund Car and Caravan at Retirement (RSP to cease at retirement)

Superannuation																	
*Maintain Sal Sac as already on highest tax bracket																	
*For Ray - Portability rollover Mine Wealth and Wellbeing - to maintain insurances and Portability rollover of south32 - as employers choice of super. (MKSF 1) - into H5 as per risk profile																	
*For Michelle - full rollover of Colonial, portable of NGS to maintain insurances (MKSF 1) - into H5 as per risk profile																	
*Withdraw URNP in Mine Wealth Wellbeing and NCC into a separate tax-free super fund for Ray (MKSF 2)																	
*Spouse contribution into Michelle's MLC Super, monthly max $3,000pa, this will enable him to get an offset, and for Michelle to be able to grow her super.																	
																	
Personal Insurance																	
* IP cover is currently $67,600pa, very underinsured, however, will be able to retire on leave payments if is unable to work. Therefore maintain IP, no additional insurances needed																	
* One year until retirement, Ray discussed potentially using his leave (close to two years) to extend retirement comfortably over another 3 years - therefore, minimum CI to give family access to Best Dcotors																	
* Michelle may not have loadings on a CI policy, therefore put in place minimum for her also. If she gets loadings due to joint/bone conditions do not proceed																	
* Maintain insurances in current super due to relatively low premiums and proximitiy to retirement.																	
																	
Other																	
*Has about 2 years of LSL, client will not be able to retire in 1 years' time and will need to take his LSL and then retire i.e. age 62																	
*Alternativeally should he receive a redundancy in 6-12 months of approx. $500K will be able to comfortably retire effective immediately - do projection to show this. 																	
																	
Estate Planning																	
* Standard will w/EPOA and EPOG - Heard McEwan																	
																	
Future Strategies																	
* When Ray is age 60, start a TTR of the taxble super (MKSF 1) and take out 10% each year (as a lump sum) and NCC every year back into the tax-free super (MKSF 2) - for approx 2 years, until retirement - age 62.																	
* Once Michelle reaches preservation age (age 56 in 2 years) , withdraw up to the $185K taxable cap and recontribute into a separate tax-free super (MKSF 2) - base on current level of super. 																	
* When Ray retires at age 62, withdraw up to cap ($540K) and recontribute into Michelle's tax free Super (MKSF 2) depending on growth, this should leave Ray with just a tax-free super.																	
* Show tax savings for recontribution strategy (based on current super levels) and tax savings for rolling into a pension (TTR prior to retirement).																	
* Excess contributions will count towards NCC cap - please take into consideration when doing the recontribution strategy i.e. $22,348pa																	
																	
Projections																	
* Assume income level is maintained for the 2 years whilst on leave. Retirement projection to go for 3 years. 																	
* Please do current, expenses can be drawn from LOC if required.

	* RSP of $1,200/m											
	* Invest both expected bonus' in 2016 & 2017 into the MKISF (Savings Plan) to H2. Don't add to Products section of the advice just strategy and modelling.											
												
MKISF - Geared 												
	* Invest $1,000 to cash

	* Fund Deposit 20% for land via direct share sale proceeds approx $72,800.											
	* Maintain car loan and repayments.											
	* Borrow $17,000 as a margin fix for 5 years

	* Maintain CBUS ($5,000) to maintain insurances.											
	* Redirect SG & salary sacrifice contributions to MLC.											
	* We are aware you may exceed the concessional contributions tax however, as you are on the highest marginal tax rate you would be taxed the same on these funds.											
	* Include a comparison of an SMSF to MLC H5. Refer to SMSF Research for details. Include some wording around the returns and diversification.											
Insurances												
	* Keep Asteron Life insurance and Keep Plum insurances, however cancel IP and replace with MLC IP. Keep CBUS insurances.

?	Kate salary sacrifices additional $6,000

Assumptions for both scenarios
1.	Kate goes to .80% FTE in 2020 ? Kate?s 2016 base income is $105,000. She is currently .60%  FTE
2.	Assume $4,000 insurance costs for Kirk and Kate paid through super
3.	Kirk and Kate retire when Kirk reaches Age 65
4.	Kirk converts to pension phase at retirement
5.	Leave Kate?s Super in Superannuation phase until new pension is required.
6.	Living expenses now and in retirement of $70,000 + $10,000 in travel 
7.	Cash accumulated in savings account in joint names
